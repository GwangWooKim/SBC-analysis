# SBC-analysis
This repository contains codes which are used in analyzing the data from DISIST. Note that (1) We can't provide the used data ('merged_count_matrix_3') and its metadata (`condtion_3`) (2) During analyzing, we figure out that the used dataset has problems (in preprocessing-level). So DIGIST has been resolving this problem. We will re-analyze the corrected data and report results. (3) The code 92-113 might not be able to work. I will deal with this part after getting the data.
